# How to Develop on This Project 
<p>Last updated: June 16, 2017</p>

<p>This project has several contributors.  We are going to probably have to experiment to get our workflow right.  This is the plan for this month. (We’ll review it’s pros and cons after one month, and either make changes, leave it as is, or scrap it.)</p>

## Branches
<p>Our new branch structure will consist of 3 branches
•	Dev
•	Demo
•	Master</p>

## Dev Branch
<p>All developers will be committing code to the Dev branch only.  This means that you need to try to work with the latest code.  This is called “getting the latest”.  Developers should communicate with one another both on Github through comments and via Trello and Google Hangouts.</p>

## Demo Branch
<p>This for our testers.  Testers will create issues on this branch.</p>

## Master Branch
<p>Our deployable code.</p>

## 4-Week Dev Cycle for Front-End Development 
<p>Day 1: All-contributor meeting, user stories & mockups released</p>
<p>Days 1 & 2: Developers divide up work, communicate with each other</p>
<p>Day 2: Development Starts</p>
<p>Day 14: All-contributor meeting, discussing development progress and challenges</p>
<p>Day 21: Development Ends, developers do pull request</p>
<p>Day 21 – 23: Commenting and pull request period, make recommended changes</p>
<p>Day 24: Bill merges Dev into Demo</p>
<p>Day 25 – 27: New feature and regression testing by testers, issues created and worked through</p>
<p>Day 28: Unresolved issues and unfinished work is folded into the next month</p>

## Back-End/Architecture Schedule
<p>This will follow its own schedule.</p>
