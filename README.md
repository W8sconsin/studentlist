## Why this app?
This app is meant to make teachers lives easier and to save time in the classroom.  Teachers, language teachers in particular, often create groups in class, keep tally of classroom participation, and other tasks using paper lists.  This can be a pain to keep track of and time consuming.  The app aspire to be a fun and practical solution for the tech-savvy teacher.
