# Student list
This open-source project is an AngularJS app that allows you to create and edit a student name list. The vision of this app is that it will allow teachers to rapidly create, manipulate, and student name lists on the fly on their tablet, smartphone, or computer while teaching their classes.

## Current project state June 5, 2017
Currently, the app is a single screen web application that allows a user (referred to hereafter as "the teacher") to rapidly create a list of students for in-class use.  The teacher adds a student using an input field and an add button.  Pressing "x" by a student name rapidly deletes a student's name.

## Upcoming user stories (ordered by priority)
  1) The teacher can click on a floating icon to open a grouping and sorting menu.
  2) The teacher can put students randomly into equal-sized, color-coded groups by clicking on a menu option.
  3) The teacher can track student participation by clicking on a menu option with a tally mark feature.
  4) The teacher can rapidly delete the whole list of students using a menu option.
  5) The teacher can randomize the student list.
  6) The teacher sees the list as alphabetized by default.
  7) The teacher can create multiple classes of students.
More to come...
  
## Why this app?
This app is meant to make teachers lives easier and to save time in the classroom.  Teachers, language teachers in particular, often create groups in class, keep tally of classroom participation, and other tasks using paper lists.  This can be a pain to keep track of and time consuming.  The app aspire to be a fun and practical solution for the tech-savvy teacher.
